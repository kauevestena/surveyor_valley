// player never sees a suspiciously square patch of marsh.

 * Ground, and how fast you can cross it.

 * The slow factors used to bottom out at 0.45 — a 1.35 m/s crawl, slower than a
 * real person walks — and marsh forms a continuous ring around every lake, so
 * any route that went near water spent its whole shoreline segment at that
 * pace. The floor is 0.8 now: the ground still reads underfoot, but nothing in
 * the valley is slower than walking.
