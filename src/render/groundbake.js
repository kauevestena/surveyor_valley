// Ground chunks: bitmaps, textures, and a work queue that never blows a frame.
//
// A 32 m chunk at 16 px/m is a 512x512 bitmap carrying a couple of thousand
// individually stamped tufts of grass. Painting one costs 15-30 ms, which is
// two lost frames if it happens inside `render`. Phase 1 did exactly that and
// walking into fresh ground stuttered.
//
// So a bake is a state machine that can be stopped mid-way. `pump(budgetMs)`
// does as much as it can afford and returns; the chunk shows a flat placeholder
// colour until it is finished. Nothing ever waits for a whole chunk, and the
// queue is sorted by distance from the camera so what you are looking at
// resolves first.
