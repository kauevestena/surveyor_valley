// travel debits time at the REAL pace, so the elapsed time shown at the end
// still means something.
//
// Everything else here exists to stop that speed reading as a sprite being
// dragged around a map. Three things do the work, and all three are about the
// difference between what the player ASKED for and what actually happened:
//
//   * velocity ramps instead of teleporting between 0 and full pace, and a turn
//     brakes sideways rather than swinging the vector round in an arc;
//   * a blocked step slides along the real contact normal, so a diagonal fence
//     is brushed past rather than zigzagged along in axis-aligned steps;
//   * the walk cycle is driven by ground COVERED, so walking into a tree stops
//     the legs too instead of moonwalking against it.
