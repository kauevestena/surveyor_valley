// The second half of the crew, and the reason the first half is allowed to stay
// at the instrument. A total station is not a one-person tool: somebody has to
// carry the prism to the point being measured and hold the pole plumb over it.
// Until this module existed the game quietly pretended otherwise — you set the
// tripod up once and then sighted the whole parcel from wherever you had
// wandered off to, which is the one thing a real survey can never do.
//
// So the rule and the character arrived together. `service.sight` now refuses
// unless the player is on the instrument, and this is who does the walking.
//
// He runs at about thirty times a real pace, which is a deliberate lie in the
// same family as the player's own 4.5 m/s: the honest alternative is watching
// somebody amble 60 m every time you want a reading, forty times a job. What
// matters is that the sight lands when he ARRIVES rather than when you click,
// so the two-person crew is something you can see rather than something the
// manual asserts.
//
// DOM-free, so `tests/assistant.test.mjs` can drive him across a real world.
