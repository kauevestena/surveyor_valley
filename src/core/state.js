// One rule holds the whole design together: a marco the player drops has *true*
// coordinates (where they actually stood) but no *known* coordinates until it
// has been surveyed. The player only ever sees surveyed values. Truth lives in
// the world, never in the state the player reads, and is revealed only in the
// end-of-service debrief as a score.

/**
 * The required relative precisions came down with the parcels, and they had to.
 *
 * Linear closure error is built from things that do not shrink: 2.5 mm of
 * instrument centring, 5.0 mm of target centring, the EDM's 10 mm constant.
 * Relative precision is perimeter over that error, so it degrades in direct
 * proportion to the figure — shrinking a parcel to a third of its area makes a
 * fixed 1:X requirement about 1.7x harder to meet, not easier.
 *
 * These numbers look loose for cadastral work, and they are — honestly so. A
 * 30-50 m parcel closed with a 10" instrument, 2.5 mm of centring and a 10 mm
 * EDM constant cannot do better; that relative precision falls with the size of
 * the figure is a real surveying fact and one worth a student meeting.
 *
 * Measured over 36 completed surveys with the starter instrument at the current
 * block size: median 1:3787, worst 1:1235. Against these three that is 0%, 8%
 * and 22% of honest surveys falling short — fácil free, difícil demanding either
 * care or a better instrument, which is what the shop is for. The best survey
 * observed closed at 1:38266, so the ceiling is the kit, not the ground.
 *
 * Missing the requirement costs quality and therefore pay; it never blocks
 * delivery.

/**
 * `batchMeasure` is a design gate rather than a tutorial one.
 *
 * "Medir todos os visíveis" measures every corner in view from one setup, which
 * is a convenience and not a skill — on médio and difícil the work is meant to
 * be done target by target, with the prism carried to each one. It is therefore
 * a property of the difficulty and not something the player earns, and the
 * button is hidden entirely rather than shown locked: a lock that can never
 * open is noise.
